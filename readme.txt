The theme of the website is a simple and clean design showcasing tables 
and various types of forms. The website serves as a sample webpage to
demonstrate the use of HTML tables and form elements. The webpage
includes a header with the website name, an "About" section 
explaining the purpose of the website, a data table displaying
information, and a contact form for users to fill out. The table
presents sample data with columns for Name, Age, and Email. The
contact form collects the user's Name, Email, Message, and provides
options for subscribing and selecting gender. The webpage is styled 
using CSS to enhance the visual appeal and provide a cohesive design. 
It aims to demonstrate the proper use of HTML tables and forms while 
maintaining a responsive and user-friendly layout.
